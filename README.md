# Pong
My implementation of Pong in Java. I made it as a base for an artificial neural network I'm going to make later.

Some basic functions I added
F5: Decrease the speed of the ball
F6: Increase the speed of the ball
F7: Restart the game
F8: Enable developer mode (currently just shows the cell grid of what the neural network will see and also disables game over and scoring)
